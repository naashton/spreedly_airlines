### About Us
We are a very small startup in our infancy. You should not use this app to book real flights for real holidays. 

You should use this app to learn about Spreedly's payment processing API. This app has implemented the basic verify, gateways, payment method, purchase API calls, as well as additional entry points, like receivers, in order to utilize `Payment Method Distribution` to use Spreedly as a proxy to process payments through 3rd party API's.
